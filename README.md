## Mobu's journal
The purpose of this journal is to keep an inventory of all the things that I picked up/learned as of yet. Mostly computer/IT related stuff but I am planning on adding personal projects (electronics, headphone amp design etc). Since it's a personal notebook, some of the notes might not be easy to decipher or might seem random but I guess that's the whole purpose of keeping a notebook.

Anybody is free to download the whole blog but a credit will be nice if you are planning on hosting it. The journal is designed to be static in nature so that it can act as an offline knowledge base.
